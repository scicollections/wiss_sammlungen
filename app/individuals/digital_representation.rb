# A weak individual that connects SciCollections with DigitalCollections in order
# to model DigitalCollections that aggregate the digital representations of several
# SciCollections.
#
# The sole purpose of this weak Individual is to store an additional URL (deep link
# to SciCollection representation in the DigitalCollection) to the URL in the
# DigitalCollection which is the address of the (possibly aggregate) DigitalCollection.
